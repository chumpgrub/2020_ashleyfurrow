## Classroom Teaching
As a classroom teacher, Iâ€™m aware of the challenges of meeting the individual needs of every learner. I use sensitive, research-based classroom management and inclusive education to help all learners feel that they have a place in our classroom community. As a classroom teacher, I also use a team approach. As teachers and parents come together, we create a power team to help students feel supported on their journey. The students are the captains, but we are all the crew there to help them navigate. [Link to online teaching portfolio](/about/portfolio/)
