Many parents and educators expressed a desire to make changes in the way that they approached the issue of race with their children and students. I worked with Inlight Institute to put together an anti-racist toolkit for educators and parents. In it, you will find resources for grades k-12, as well as resources for adults who want to educate themselves. In addition, there are multi-level curricular ideas that can be implemented right away.
