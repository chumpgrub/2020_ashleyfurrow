## Educational Philosophy
My [approach](/about/approach/) to teaching is to help learners to feel in charge of their own learning. Oftentimes students feel like they go to school and learning is thrust upon them, not that they are the ones piloting the ship. This isnâ€™t a one-size-fits-all approach.
