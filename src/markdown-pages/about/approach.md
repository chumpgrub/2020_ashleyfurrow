intro: Each captain has to outfit his or her ship in a way that works best for them. As they start to learn how they learn best, students learn to self-monitor their own journey as they apply the skills in school and in life.

I use a multi-sensory approach. What does that mean? It means that I use all types of learning - kinaesthetic, oral, visual, whatever works! I help students to be aware of their own strengths and areas where they need to focus a bit more in order to improve. I teach them to set their own goals. I’m not working on them; I’m working with them. Helping a child to feel supported and safe, yet encouraged to accept challenges with a growth mindset is key to treating all students with dignity.

My approach is to help them to feel in charge of their own learning. Oftentimes students feel like they go to school and learning is thrust upon them, not that they are the ones piloting the ship. Like any good captain, children need a sturdy, seagoing vessel. I help them to patch any holes in their learning, such as phonemic awareness, reading readiness, word-attack skills, comprehension, higher-order thinking skills, organization and planning. This isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. Each captain has to outfit his or her ship in a way that works best for them. As they start to learn how they learn best, students learn to self-monitor their own journey as they apply the skills at home and in school.
