Parents who choose to homeschool their children often need some support along the way. My PhD work has focused some on homeschooling and ways to successfully implement such a methodology. My knowledge about the ways in which students most successfully take in information and commit learning to long-term memory help me to facilitate home school programs for families. I am available to help parents make sure their children are “on track” as well as an academic tutor in a variety of subject matters. Most often I work cross-curricularly, using student’s innate interests to help guide academic learning. A love of horses can lead to an intense study of biology and expository or creative writing. A child who enjoys making paper airplanes can follow this passion to learn about math and aerodynamics. I have access to research-based curricula that can help with any remediation that a child might need in order to succeed in areas where his or her interests lie.
