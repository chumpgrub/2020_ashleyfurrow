I received my PhD in Education from Trinity University in Dublin, Ireland. In addition, I have a Master of Arts in Education (M.A. Ed) and a Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A) from the University of New Mexico, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude. I have been in private practice as a learning specialist for 19 years. Before this I worked as a classroom teacher and reading specialist in both American and British curriculums in International Baccalaureate schools in Europe and in the Middle East. I have extensive teaching experience in grades K-12 and through this have culled the best multi-sensorial, child-driven techniques and methods in order to meet each student’s individual needs. These include Understanding By Design, Responsive Classroom, Universal Design for Learning, project-based learning, Wilson Reading Method ®, Lindamood-Bell’s Visualizing and Verbalizing ®, Writers Workshop, Structured Word Inquiry, and Collaborative Problem Solving ®.
