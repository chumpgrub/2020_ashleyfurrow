intro: Educators faced with the switch to remote learning have felt as if they are “inventing the car while they are driving it.”

I have been using remote learning in my private practice for years as a learning specialist. I was also tasked with switching my own classroom to online this spring. I have learned some excellent classroom management techniques (no, it’s not just using the mute function) and ways to differentiate learning so that all students are able to equally benefit from an online learning platform. I am happy to offer professional development and resources for educators who feel that they need assistance in being a more effective teacher when working remotely.

In addition, parents who choose to homeschool their children often need some support along the way. My PhD work has focused some on homeschooling and ways to successfully implement such a methodology. My knowledge about the ways in which students most successfully take in information and commit learning to long-term memory help me to facilitate home school programs for families. I am available to help parents make sure their children are “on track” as well as an academic tutor in a variety of subject matters.

Most often I work cross-curricularly, using student’s innate interests to help guide academic learning. A love of horses can lead to an intense study of biology and expository or creative writing. A child who enjoys making paper airplanes can follow this passion to learn about math and aerodynamics. I have access to research-based curricula that can help with any remediation that a child might need in order to succeed in areas where his or her interests lie.
